# category-papers

A collection of category theory papers I am happy to discuss with you

- Traced monoïdal categories, by André Joyal, Street, Verity : This introduces a trace operation which is very frequente and allow to represent, for instance, recursion.
- Critère de representabilité, par Jean Bénabou : An exhaustive take on equivalent criteria under which a functor A -> Set is represented by an object in A
- Bicategories of spans and relations, by Carboni, Street, Kasangian : A close look at the mentioned bicategories
- Caractérisation de Dist, par Gouzou et Grunig : An isomorphism between Span and Dist
- Limits indexed by category-valued 2-functors, by Street : This allows to characterise a category as a limit.
- Comprehension structures, by yours truly and Melliès : Many advanced categorical notions come from separating two worlds connected by a functor. This investigates a particular connection, called comprehension. An exemple of a comprehension is building the category of elements for a set-valued functor.
